After cloning this repo and opening it in your code editor, open a new terminal and run install.  

Once everything is installed go to rapidapi.com and create a free account to access an API Key.

Once you have your API Key go to the utils folder and open the FetchApi file. Under this file you should see in the Header exactly where to paste your API Key.  Once this is done you should be ready to start the development server and view the site!
